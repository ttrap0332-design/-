## Introduction

This quickstart guide will help you understand the essential components of BLEU and the initial steps to participate in the ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

To participate in the BLEU ecosystem, you should understand:

* Blockchain technology and tokenomics
* Governance through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
* Environmental NFTs (ENFTs) and digital asset management

## Understanding the token ecosystem

BLEU uses multiple specialized tokens:

| Token | Purpose | Use Case |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Blu-Tillion (BT) | Primary value token | Energy, infrastructure finance |
| Zioniare (ZN) | Regional vault operations | Infrastructure bonds, broker charters |
| HealCoin (HL) | Health services | Clinic payments, medical royalties |
| HarvestCoin (HC) | Food production | Produce tokenization, food reserves |
| ScrollCoin (SC) | Knowledge and education | Tuition, research royalties |
| FlameCoin (FC) | Defense operations | Military funding, peace dividends |
| HydroCoinΩ | Water rights | Planetary water management |
| NeuraCoin | Cognitive labor | AI education royalties |

## Initial setup (Next 48 hours)

The BLEU system has seven critical actions for initial deployment:

### 1. Activate Phiyah multisig

The Phiyah Multisig Seal is the constitutional signing authority. Activation requires:

* Establishing the signing quorum
* Distributing private keys to authorized signatories
* Testing the multisig smart contract

### 2. Deploy ReparationsVault testnet

The ReparationsVault handles lineage-based economic flows:

* Deploy smart contracts to testnet
* Verify vault creation and token minting
* Test inflow/outflow audit trails

### 3. Onboard first Node Council

Node Councils govern locally through direct democracy:

* Select initial council members
* Distribute ScrollCoin for reputation weighting
* Establish governance procedures

### 4. Issue Genesis ENFT batch

Environmental NFTs (ENFTs) represent all actions and assets:

* Mint Genesis batch #BLEUKAINE 10
* Assign ENFTs to founding participants
* Establish provenance hash chains

### 5. Begin HealCoin Clinic rollout

Deploy the first 50 clinic nodes:

* Set up 1 Node = 1 Clinic + 1 Vault + 1 HydroFarm
* Establish HealCoin flow mechanisms
* Onboard initial healers with DIDs

### 6. Register Broker Guild Constitution

Establish the 12 regional broker guild federations:

* Draft and ratify guild constitution
* Register under Zioniare charter
* Set up anti-piracy lineage hash verification

### 7. Publish public BLEUPlan white-scroll

Create comprehensive documentation:

* Publish white-scroll for tribal review
* Distribute to all stakeholders
* Gather feedback for refinement

## Economic KPIs to monitor

Track these metrics every 90 days:

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| BVI growth | +12% | Blu-Tillion output per capita |
| Reciprocity Index | ≥ 0.93 | Community dividends / gross yield |
| Food independence | 24 mo buffer | HarvestCoin reserves |
| Energy autonomy | 95% | Solar + resonance reactor uptime |
