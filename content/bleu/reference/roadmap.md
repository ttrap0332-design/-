## Critical path and dependencies

### Parallel workstreams

Many activities can proceed simultaneously:

* **Economic**: Treasury and token deployment
* **Health**: Clinic rollout and healer onboarding
* **Infrastructure**: Construction and energy systems
* **Governance**: Council formation and procedures
* **Education**: MetaSchools and training programs

### Sequential dependencies

Some activities must follow others:

```
Foundation → Growth → Maturation

Phiyah Multisig → Constitutional amendments
Reparations Vault → Lineage tracking
Node Councils → Local governance
Clinics → Health outcomes
MetaSchools → Specialist training
Markets → Price discovery
Oracles → Verification → Minting
```

### Risk mitigation

**Technical risks:**

* Parallel development of backup systems
* Extensive testing before production deployment
* Gradual rollout with monitoring
* Quick rollback capabilities
* Expert consultation and review

**Social risks:**

* Extensive community engagement and feedback
* Transparent communication about plans
* Flexibility to adjust based on input
* Conflict resolution mechanisms ready
* Cultural sensitivity and adaptation

**Economic risks:**

* Conservative initial token allocation
* Multiple safeguards against manipulation
* Diverse economic activities
* Reserve buffers for emergencies
* Continuous monitoring and adjustment
