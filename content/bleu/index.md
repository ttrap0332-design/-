## About BLEU

The BLEU (Blockchain-Linked Economic Unity) system is a civilization-grade engine that operates on the principle that every act that sustains life must itself generate yield. It integrates multiple pillars into one cohesive organism:

* **Macro-Economy**: A layered monetary ecology with tokens like Blu-Tillion, Zioniare, and specialized coins
* **HealVerse**: A planetary health grid combining clinical infrastructure with ancestral medicine
* **MetaMilitary**: Defense as ceremony with specialized divisions for each element
* **Intelligence**: The Phiyah Protocol Mesh for data integrity and security
* **Infrastructure**: Planetary gridwork including transport, energy, and urban systems
* **Trade**: MirrorMarket 2.0 for cross-node ENFT exchanges
* **Education**: The Azaean Grid for workforce development
* **Governance**: Node Council to Tribunal to Treasury Chain

## Key principles

The BLEU system operates through a continual prosperity engine with the feedback loop:

**Harvest → Mint → Heal → Educate → Defend → Trade → Govern → Harvest**

Each loop is verified by oracles, with yields routed automatically to lineage and community wallets. The system uses Virtue Coefficients where **Compassion × Truth × Timing = Reciprocity Score**, and only yields with a score greater than 0.7 qualify for remint bonuses.
