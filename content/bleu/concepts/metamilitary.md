## Overview

The MetaMilitary operates on the doctrine: **Protect, never pre-empt. Retrieve, never extract.** It treats defense as a ceremonial responsibility rather than aggressive projection of force.

## Core doctrine

### Protect, never pre-empt

* **Defensive posture**: All operations are reactive to actual threats
* **No first strikes**: Military action only in response to aggression
* **Sanctuary focus**: Protecting people, infrastructure, and environment
* **De-escalation priority**: Seeking peaceful resolution before force

### Retrieve, never extract

* **Resource ethics**: Taking only what is needed for defense
* **Restoration obligation**: Repairing damage caused by operations
* **Cultural respect**: Protecting heritage sites and traditions
* **Environmental stewardship**: Minimizing ecological impact

## Governance and authorization

Military operations require multiple layers of approval.

### Ritual Triad approval

All major operations require consent from:

1. **MetaOps Command**: Military leadership assessment of necessity
2. **ScrollMint Tribunal**: Legal and ethical review
3. **Node Council**: Democratic approval from affected communities

### Authorization criteria

Operations must meet these standards:

* **Imminent threat**: Clear and present danger to people or infrastructure
* **Proportional response**: Force level appropriate to threat
* **Minimal harm**: Lowest casualty approach prioritized
* **Documentation**: All decisions recorded as audit ENFTs

### FlameCoin time-locks

Military funding uses time-locked smart contracts:

* **Gradual release**: Funds unlock as mission parameters are met
* **Milestone verification**: Oracle confirmation required for each release
* **Accountability**: All expenditures tracked and auditable
* **Recovery**: Unused funds return to treasury

### Tribunal ENFT logs

All military actions create permanent records:

* **Operation details**: Mission parameters and authorization
* **Resource usage**: Personnel, equipment, and FlameCoin expenditure
* **Outcomes**: Results, casualties, damage assessments
* **Archive**: Sealed logs stored in ScrollCoin Knowledge Net

## Peace yield system

Successful defensive operations generate positive economic outcomes.

### Peace Dividends

When defense operations successfully protect civilians:

* **Trigger**: Verified protection of population or infrastructure
* **Distribution**: Blu-Tillion released to affected communities
* **Calculation**: Based on:
  * Population protected
  * Infrastructure preserved
  * Threat severity
  * Operation efficiency

### Dividend allocation

Peace Dividends flow through multiple channels:

```
Defense Success → Peace Dividend Pool → Distribution:
  - 50%: Direct to affected civilians
  - 30%: Infrastructure rebuilding
  - 15%: Healer support (treating wounded)
  - 5%: Archives (documenting events)
```

### Verification process

Peace Dividend releases require:

* **Oracle confirmation**: Independent verification of operation success
* **Node Council approval**: Local democratic validation
* **Tribunal certification**: Legal confirmation of proper conduct
* **ENFT minting**: Permanent record of dividend distribution
