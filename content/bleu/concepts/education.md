## Overview

The Azaean Grid is BLEU's education and workforce development system, operating through MetaSchools that blend trade academy training with philosophical temple wisdom.

## MetaSchools structure

Educational institutions combining practical and philosophical learning.

### Hybrid model

**Trade academy component:**

* **Focus**: Practical skills for economic participation
* **Subjects**: 
  * Health sciences and healing arts
  * Infrastructure engineering and maintenance
  * Agricultural and food production techniques
  * Energy systems management
  * Digital and cyber skills
  * Trade and market operations

**Philosophy temple component:**

* **Focus**: Ethical framework and wisdom traditions
* **Subjects**:
  * BLEU constitutional principles
  * Virtue Coefficient philosophy
  * Governance and civic participation
  * Cultural heritage and lineage
  * Conflict resolution and peacemaking

### Integration approach

Blending practical and philosophical:

* **Project-based learning**: Real-world problems with ethical dimensions
* **Mentorship**: Experienced practitioners guide students
* **Service learning**: Contributing to community while learning
* **Cross-disciplinary**: Combining multiple domains in coursework
* **Lifelong learning**: Continuous education throughout career

## Token economics

Education funded through the Azaean token system.

### Azaean token

Primary educational currency:

* **Use**: Tuition payments for courses and programs
* **Distribution**: Every student wallet seeded with 10 Azaean
* **Generation**: MetaSchools receive Azaean allocations based on enrollment
* **Value**: Backed by human capital development
* **Governance**: Node Councils oversee local MetaSchools

### ScrollCoin royalties

Ongoing compensation for educators:

* **Mechanism**: Teachers earn ScrollCoin for knowledge contributions
* **Generation**: Created when students apply learned knowledge
* **Perpetual**: Continues as knowledge propagates through civilization
* **Katif-grade remints**: Special bonuses issued each semester
* **Purpose**: Incentivizes high-quality teaching

**Katif-grade remints:**

* Issued at harvest season (Shavuot)
* Based on student outcomes and success
* Teacher reputation weighted
* Compounds over teaching career
* Recognizes long-term knowledge impact

### Student grants

Initial educational support:

* **Seeding**: 10 Azaean + 1 ScrollCoin per new student
* **Purpose**: Ensures access regardless of background
* **Source**: BLEULIONTREASURY Prime educational allocation
* **Restrictions**: Can only be used for educational purposes
* **Expiration**: Must be used within enrollment period
