## Energy and food systems

Integrated systems for power generation and food production.

### Energy infrastructure

## Urban form and node cities

Each node city follows a standardized three-ring structure.

### Genesis Ring (Core)

The central hub of economic and civic activity:

* **Function**: Government, commerce, primary services
* **Density**: Highest population and building concentration
* **Design**: Vertical integration with green spaces
* **Infrastructure**: All transportation modes converge here
* **Tokens**: All tokens in active circulation

**Key facilities:**

* Node Council chambers
* Regional Vault
* Primary clinics
* Educational centers
* MirrorMarket exchanges

### Memory Belt

## Building tokenization

All structures are registered as ENFTs with economic implications.

### ENFT registration

Every building is logged with:

* **Physical attributes**: Location, size, materials, systems
* **Ownership records**: Current and historical owners
* **Maintenance history**: Repairs, upgrades, inspections
* **Energy performance**: Consumption and generation data
* **Token integration**: Payment systems and royalty flows

### Maintenance royalties

Buildings generate ongoing value for builders:

* **Mechanism**: Small percentage of rent/usage flows to builders
* **Duration**: Perpetual or time-limited based on agreement
* **Token**: Typically paid in Blu-Tillion or Zioniare
* **Purpose**: Incentivizes quality construction
* **Tracking**: All payments recorded on-chain

### Performance incentives

Efficient buildings earn bonuses:

* **Energy efficiency**: Low consumption earns Blu-Tillion bonuses
* **Water conservation**: HydroCoinΩ rewards for efficiency
* **Durability**: Long maintenance cycles earn reputation
* **Adaptability**: Easy retrofitting earns design credits

## Infrastructure coordination

* **Lines 2-4**: Primary conduits for power, data, water
* **Ziphonate Cores**: Connected for power distribution
* **PlasmaPearl Reactors**: Backup and peak capacity
* **Monitoring**: Real-time sensor networks
* **Maintenance**: Preventive scheduling through oracles

### Oracle integration

Physical infrastructure monitored by quantum oracles:
