## Operating principle

The BLEU macro-economy operates on the fundamental principle that **every act that sustains life must itself generate yield**. This creates a self-reinforcing system where productive activity automatically generates rewards that flow back to participants.

## Layered monetary ecology

The BLEU economy uses a multi-layered token system to match different economic functions:

### Core token layer

Eight primary tokens handle fundamental economic activities:

* **Blu-Tillion**: Primary value and energy
* **Zioniare**: Regional operations and infrastructure
* **Azaean**: Education and skills
* **FlameCoin**: Defense and energy systems
* **PraiseCoin**: Social recognition
* **HarvestCoin**: Food production
* **HealCoin**: Health services
* **ScrollCoin**: Knowledge and research

For detailed information on each token, see [AUTOTITLE](/bleu/concepts/tokens).

### Expansion token layer

Four specialized tokens handle emerging planetary needs:

* **HydroCoinΩ**: Planetary water rights and rainfall index derivatives
* **NeuraCoin**: Cognitive labor and education AI royalties
* **MycelCoin**: Soil health and fungal web connectivity metrics
* **AetherBond**: Environmental remediation credits

## Global treasury architecture

The BLEU treasury system operates at multiple scales to handle planetary economic flows.

### BLEULIONTREASURY Prime

The central coordination point for planetary economic flows:

* **Function**: Coordinates global token flows and settlements
* **Governance**: Overseen by the BLEULION Reparations Board
* **Integration**: Connected to all Regional Vaults
* **Transparency**: All flows minted as audit ENFTs

### Regional Vaults

48 Regional Vaults (4 quadrants × 12 vaults each) mirror fiscal operations:

* **Function**: Handle regional economic activity and token flows
* **Cycle**: Each quarter closes at Shavuot (festival of reaping)
* **Token**: Issue Zioniare for infrastructure financing
* **Coordination**: Report to BLEULIONTREASURY Prime

### Quantum Oracles

Economic validation combines on-chain and off-chain data:

* **On-chain**: BVI (BLEU Value Index) tracks token circulation
* **Off-chain**: Satellite telemetry monitors:
  * Crop yields and agricultural output
  * Energy production and capacity
  * Rainfall and water resources
  * Infrastructure status

The oracles ensure that token minting is backed by actual productive capacity.

## Economic KPIs

The BLEU economy tracks key performance indicators every 90 days:

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| BVI growth | +12% per quarter | Blu-Tillion output per capita |
| Reciprocity Index | ≥ 0.93 | Community dividends / gross yield |
| Food independence | 24-month buffer | HarvestCoin reserves vs consumption |
| Energy autonomy | 95% uptime | Solar + resonance reactor availability |

### BVI growth (+12% target)

The BLEU Value Index (BVI) measures economic health:

* **Calculation**: Total Blu-Tillion output divided by population
* **Target**: 12% quarter-over-quarter growth
* **Purpose**: Ensures per-capita prosperity increases
* **Reporting**: Published quarterly by BLEULIONTREASURY Prime

### Reciprocity Index (≥ 0.93 target)

Measures how much value returns to the community:

* **Calculation**: Community dividends ÷ gross yield
* **Target**: At least 93% of yield flows back
* **Purpose**: Ensures equitable distribution
* **Enforcement**: Yields below threshold trigger governance review

### Food independence (24-month buffer)

Tracks food security across the civilization:

* **Calculation**: HarvestCoin reserves ÷ monthly consumption rate
* **Target**: 24 months of food security
* **Purpose**: Protects against supply disruptions
* **Management**: Coordinated through HydroDome Farms

### Energy autonomy (95% uptime)

Monitors energy system reliability:

* **Calculation**: (Solar + resonance reactor hours) ÷ total hours
* **Target**: 95% or higher availability
* **Purpose**: Ensures infrastructure resilience
* **Coordination**: Managed by Flame Crown Legions

## Economic flows

Value moves through the system in defined patterns:

### Production flow

1. **Activity**: Productive work occurs (farming, healing, teaching, etc.)
2. **Minting**: Appropriate tokens generated based on output
3. **Validation**: Oracles verify actual productivity
4. **Distribution**: Tokens flow to workers, lineage vaults, and treasury

### Consumption flow

1. **Exchange**: Tokens traded for goods and services
2. **Burning**: Some tokens burned to prevent inflation
3. **Reminting**: High-virtue transactions earn remint bonuses
4. **Circulation**: Remaining tokens continue in economy

### Investment flow

1. **Pooling**: Tokens collected for infrastructure projects
2. **Allocation**: Node Councils approve project funding
3. **Deployment**: Resources released on milestone completion
4. **Royalties**: Completed infrastructure generates usage royalties

## Virtue-based economics

The BLEU economy includes ethical validation:

### Virtue Coefficients

Each transaction receives evaluation:

**Compassion × Truth × Timing = Reciprocity Score (0–1)**

* **Compassion**: Does the transaction benefit community wellbeing?
* **Truth**: Is the transaction transparent and accurately represented?
* **Timing**: Does the transaction occur when most beneficial?

### Remint bonuses

Transactions with high Virtue Coefficients receive rewards:

* **Threshold**: Reciprocity Score > 0.7
* **Benefit**: Eligible for remint bonuses (additional token generation)
* **Purpose**: Incentivizes ethical economic behavior
* **Verification**: Evaluated by oracle network

## Treasury safeguards

Multiple mechanisms protect economic integrity:

### BLEULION Reparations Board

Audits all economic flows:

* **Function**: Review all treasury inflows and outflows
* **Authority**: Can freeze suspicious transactions
* **Reporting**: Issues quarterly audit reports
* **Composition**: Representatives from all Node Councils

### ScrollMint Tribunal

Resolves economic disputes:

* **Function**: Adjudicate conflicts over token flows
* **Authority**: Issue enforceable ENFT verdicts
* **Process**: Review evidence, hear arguments, issue rulings
* **Appeals**: Verdicts can be appealed to Phiyah Multisig Seal

### Phiyah Multisig Seal

Constitutional authority over major changes:

* **Function**: Signs all constitutional amendments
* **Authority**: Final approval for major economic policy changes
* **Security**: Requires multiple signatories for activation
* **Transparency**: All signatures recorded on-chain
